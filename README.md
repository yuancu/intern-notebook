# Notebooks on NLP-related AWS Services

This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks that I have run when playing around with AWS's NLP related services, i.e. SageMaker, Neptune, Comprehend, etc.

Many of them requires special configuration on environments. Links to aws console and notebooks pages are only for my own reference.
